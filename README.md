# Question-Answer program

## Introduction
Simple Question Answer program based on the student directory of my college. Because of the sensible information, the actual database is not shared here, but you can see the code and some of the conversations I have had yet with the program. Instead of searching for an information for minutes, get the answer in a second. 
Check the video for a demonstration of the program.

## Sample of conversation

I am the user Darth Vader and after each question the program is answering. Considering the sensibility of the information used, I did not upload the database and only share a document where I asked a bunch of questions about myself. Hope you enjoy. There is a lot of room for improvement but I am already happy not to have to go through all the 65 pages of the student directory.
